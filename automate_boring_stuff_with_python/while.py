# with an if statement

spam = 1
# if spam < 5:
#    print('Hello, World.')
#    spam = spam + 1
#    print(spam)  # to see what happens!

# the if statement the condition is "True", so then it print one time
# and add  + 1 to spam, in the final spam has a value of 2

while spam < 5:
    print('Hello, World.')
    spam = spam + 1
    print(spam)  # to see the loop dinamically

# In the another hand the while loop prints repeteadly 4 times 'Hello, World.'
# It will print only 4 times only because (< 5), so it's True until 4 < 5.
